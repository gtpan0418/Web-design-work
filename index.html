            <h1 class="title">Taiwan</h1>
        </div>

        <p class="content1">
            Taiwan is a great place to travel. There are dozens of outlying islands to explore including Green Island, Orchid Island, or the Penghu Islands. Taipei, the capital and largest city, offers great shopping and dining experiences. Hualien and Taitung are renowned for their beautiful coastlines. Kenting in the south has earned the reputation as the “Asian Hawaii.” Sun Moon Lake in the central mountain range boasts some of the most gorgeous bicycling in the world, while Qingjing Farm shows off Taiwan’s alpine pasturelands. A wealth of food and entertainment exists all throughout Taiwan including delicious snacks and wonderful music festivals.

            <h1 class="title">Japan</h1>
        </div>

        <p class="content1">
            Japan is a remarkable conundrum: deeply traditional yet also strangely forward thinking; innovative yet entrenched – it is a country that is compelling and also vexing. Just when you might think you understand it, you realize how much more there is to comprehend. For the traveler there are few, if any other countries and cultures, that make such a lasting impression. Steeped in history, shaped by a strict cultural tradition but eager today to engage with the world, Japan is a wonderful travel destination.

            <h1 class="title">America</h1>
        </div>

        <p class="content1">
            USA is as vast and varied as all of Europe. The best way to tackle the Land of the Free is to plan your trip by a large chunk or region, or take it slow by diving deep into one state per trip. Visit time and again over the decades and you still won’t likely see it all.
            We’re a family that loves nature activities like hiking, biking, wildlife spotting and camping, and there is no better place for that then the incredible national parks in the USA.It's what makes this country so unique and mezmerizing and is a great way to unplug, to reconnect to what is important: quality time with those you love in nature.

            <h1 class="title">Europe</h1>
        </div>

        <p class="content1">
            Europe is the most popular destination this year, according to Hopper’s “Summer Travel to Europe” report. Demand has already outpaced 2019 levels, according to the report, even as hotel prices surge and airfares are the highest in five years. London, Paris, Rome, Lisbon and Athens are among the most booked cities on the Hopper travel app, and the Sicilian city of Palermo, which is also featured in “The White Lotus,” is among the top trending destinations.
